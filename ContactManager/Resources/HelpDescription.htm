			<h2>
						ContactManager</h2>
				<h3>
						Description</h3>
				<p>
						<b>ContactManager</b> was born out of a frustration with Outlook and Gmail 
						contact management, which don&#39;t include the notion of &#39;household&#39; - 
						this 
						makes it difficult to manage (for example) a family&#39;s address, at the same time 
						as individual mobile phone numbers.</p>
				<p>
						<b>ContactManager</b> is very basic: it doesn&#39;t send or receive emails, doesn&#39;t 
						do mail merges. All it does is manage contacts, and people. A contact can be a 
						business, or a family. Each contact can &#39;contain&#39; zero or more people. There 
						are 
						a limited number of fields that <b>ContactManager</b> knows about (address, phone 
						number, email, birthday etc.). Anything else can be added to the &#39;Notes&#39; field. </p>
				<h3>
						Getting Started</h3>
				<p>
						To create a new contact, click the &#39;New...&#39; button. In the field which appears, 
						simply type the name and address of the contact:</p>
				<p class="style1">
						Bill &amp; Jane Dobbs<br />
						23 Calverley Hill<br />
						Reading<br />
						RG5 2LP<br />
						0867 8498 4513<br />
						billandjane@mail.com</p>
				<p>
						<b>ContactManager</b> will interpret the first line as the name, and will 
						recognise names in the form &quot;Bill &amp; Jane&quot; as being two people (and Bill, Jane &amp; 
						Tim as three people, etc..). A line containing just numbers will be interpreted 
						as a phone number. A line with an &#39;@&#39; symbol will be interpreted as an email 
						address</p>
				<p>
						Note that you only <span class="style2">have</span> to enter the name part. The 
						other parts are optional.</p>
				<p>
						You can also &#39;quick edit&#39; an existing contact in the same way, by clicking on 
						the &#39;Edit...&#39; button.</p>
	
			<h3>
						&#39;Advanced&#39; edition</h3>
				<p>
						To edit more details of a contact, click on the &#39;Details...&#39; button. Here it is 
						possible to add/remove/reorder people, and include extra details. Note that the 
						date format for birth dates is currently (dd.mm.yyyy). The little check box in 
						front of each person indicates whether the person&#39;s first name is included in 
						the display name for the contact as a whole.</p>
				<p>
						The &#39;Is business&#39; checkbox is used by <b>ContactManager</b> to determine how to 
						generate the display name of the Contact.</p>
				<p>
						To delete a contact, use the &#39;Delete...&#39; button at the bottom of the main 
						window. Note that there is no &#39;are you sure?&#39; confirmation - as you can easily 
						undo the delete action from the Edition -&gt; Undo menu. In fact, all modifications 
						can be undone/redone, as in any standard application.</p>
				<p>
						It is also possible to merge several contacts together, or to split an existing 
						contact into one contact for each person. Experiment with this functionality to 
						get a better idea of how to use it (remember, you can always undo).<i> (Tip: 
						when merging, the order in which you select the contacts (Ctrl-Click to select 
						multiple contacts) determines the order in which the people will be included in 
						the merged contact).</i></p>
				<h3>
						Searching</h3>
				<p>
						The filter button at the bottom of the main window performs a basic single-word 
						search on all fields of contacts and associated people.</p>
				<h3>
						Birthdays</h3>
				<p>
						On startup, the application displays a &#39;Upcoming birthdays&#39; window, with 
						birthdays in the next N days. The slider can be used to modify the number of 
						days. It is also possible to use the text field to filter (on people fields), 
						and to limit to decade birthdays.</p>
				<h3>
						Backups</h3>
				<p>
						<b>ContactManager</b> is designed to be very &#39;safe&#39;. Combined with the Undo 
						functionality, <b>ContactManager</b> archives a dated &#39;backup&#39; copy of your address 
						book every time you save changes. In case of error, it is possible to load 
						previous versions.</p>
				<p>
						The default file name format for these backup files is (for example):
						<span class="style1">09.09.2009@09.09.09 AddressBook.xml</span></p>
				<h3>
						Import/Export</h3>
				<p>
						<b>ContactManager</b> can import and export files in several different formats. 
						However, note that these functions are mostly not symmetrical (the only format 
						that <b>ContactManager</b> can import and export is its own AddressBook xml 
						format).</p>
				<p>
						Currently, the .csv <span class="style4">import</span> functions are limited to semi-colon (;) separated 
						files. (Comma separated files are a bit too complicated). This may present some 
						problems depending on your &#39;regional settings&#39;. (One not-very-elegant solution 
						is to modify your computer&#39;s regional settings, import the file into excel, the 
						change the regional settings and save back to csv.)</p>
				<p>
						As with the add function, <b>ContactManager</b> will attempt to interpret the 
						name as one or more people. Depending on the number of people, the presence or 
						not of home &amp; work phone numbers and email addresses, <b>ContactManager</b> will 
						make a guess on whether the contact is a business or not, and on whether the 
						email addresses are personal or for the contact as a whole.</p>
				<p>
						The different .csv functions relate to the names of the rows that <b>
						ContactManager</b> expects to find in the file:</p>
				<p>
						<b>Outlook import:</b></p>
				<blockquote>
						<span class="style3">First Name</span><br class="style3" />
						<span class="style3">Last Name </span>
						<br class="style3" />
						<span class="style3">Street </span>

						<br class="style3" />

						<br class="style3" />
						<span class="style3">E-mail 2 Address </span></blockquote>
				<p style="font-weight: 700">
						Generic import:</p>
				<blockquote>
						<span class="style3">BirthDate </span>

						<span class="style3">BirthDay </span>

						<br class="style3" />

						<br class="style3" />
						<span class="style3">Notes</span> </blockquote>
	
			<h3>
						Export</h3>
				<p>
						The export functions are fairly straightforward. One important thing to note is 
						that exports operate on the <b>filtered</b> list. This is useful for exporting a 
						sub-set of your contacts.</p>
				<p>
						(Note: the exported csv files use the separator defined in your computer&#39;s 
						regional settings.)</p>
				<h3>
						Future development</h3>
				<ul>
						<li>Permit localised date formats</li>
						<li>Permit comma-separated csv</li>
						<li>Improve usability (tool tips etc.)</li>
						<li>Add keyboard shortcuts (undo/redo/save etc.)</li>
						<li>Introduce notion of &#39;archive/hide&#39; (instead of delete)</li>
						<li>Categories?</li>
						<li>Localise texts (for other languages)</li>
				</ul>
